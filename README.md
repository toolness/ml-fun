This repository contains a bunch of machine learning experiments I'm
doing.

## Experiments

Here's what I've got so far:

* [Brooklyn housing price predictions](bk-housing/BkHousing.ipynb) - Experiments with linear regression and gradient descent.
* [Super simple neural net](super-simple-nn.ipynb) - A ridiculously simple neural net.

## Running locally

To run the Jupyter notebook experiments on your own system, run:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```
